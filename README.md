You are reading Psalm 1
----------------
Psalms 1:1 | How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand in the pathway with sinners, or sit in the assembly of scoffers!
Psalms 1:2 | Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the Lordâ€™s commands; he meditates on his commands day and night.
Psalms 1:3 | He is like a tree planted by flowing streams; it yields its fruit at the proper time, and its leaves never fall off. He succeeds in everything he attempts.
Psalms 1:4 | Not so with the wicked! Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
Psalms 1:5 | For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment, nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
Psalms 1:6 | Certainly the Lord guards the way of the godly, but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.
